# Auto-Sell-Fated-Fortune-Cards
Source code for my WoW addon

This addon scans through your bags when you talk to any merchant, and sells any "Fated Fortune Cards" that are in your inventory.

When interacting with a merchant, if any Fortune Cards are found it displays the number of cards sold.

Very minimalist addon that only affects you when you have Fated Fortune Cards.
